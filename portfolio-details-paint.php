						 <h3>Background</h3>
						 <p class="mt15">Organizing paint party events requires coordinating with artists and venues to managing registrations
							and art supplies. Existing event management platforms lacked specialized features tailored to the unique requirements
							of paint party organizers. This led to inefficiencies, including manual data entry, cumbersome coordination processes,

							Additionally, procuring art supplies on time and in the right quantities demands streamlined procurement processes.

							payment processing integration was crucial for successful financial transactions.</p>
